# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Face recognition with webcam.

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A program detect our facial movement through webcam. And we're tring to use landmarks. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our software will detect our facial movement when we pass through webcam.  It will analyze the visual input to determine whether a personâ€™s facial features are present. We will set up this project by importing packages such as OpenCV to achieve our goal. We hope to display our face with landmarks on us. If not applicable, we will use squares instead of landmarks.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Greta Wang tup38481@temple.edu TA:Elmira Talebianaraki
Ting An Andy Wang tup35913@temple.edu TA:Elmira Talebianaraki

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Let the project recognize the facial movements which are presented in images or videos by adding square frames.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Let the project recognize the facial movements with web in images or videos by adding square frames.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Let the project recognize the facial movements with web in images or videos by adding landmarks.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?


What new skills will you need to acquire?
-Learning how to use Pycharm to create the project.
-Learning to use the Python libraries.
-Square frame & 468 Face Landmarks
-Learning how to import images and videos into Python.
-Learning how to connect the webcam to our software.
-Learning the proper way to construct a project such as Dunder methods

What topics will you need to research?
-Square frame & 468 Face Landmarks 
-The logic of face recognition
